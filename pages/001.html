<h2> tarot vibrato ( I have a relationship with Tarot again)</h2>
Diary of 2023-08-29<br>
<br>

#life-update<br>
Had to cancel the dropbox account 1 hr after opening it...<br>
but the good news is my C programming book arrived today...<br>
K.N. King's C Programming ~ A Modern Approach (second edition)<br>
I picked it out because it was highly recommended and I resonate with the cover<br>
Art is the primary motivation I have to learn programming<br>

<h2>The tarot reading from yesterday</h2><br>
the heart of the romance engine is the romatic poet.... a knight of cups..<br>
there is an overly fanciful charactarisitc to this person<br>
or this fantasy engine<br>
I'm good at fantasy<br>
when I fantasized the DVD8 on the DC<br>
now i have to imagine, that fantasizing about a 3d vn engine could be<br>
just another work of fiction that I cannot do (edit: or it's something that needs to be born out of literature first)<br>
but my pride is strong<br>
that isn't the final answer<br>
the problems that could arise from attempt the engine are deep struggles<br>
five of pentacles... there is serious difficulty in the coding.<br>
that i could feel unable to break through, as if distraught<br>
on outside of the church<br>
inside the church being, all the glory of having your fully working engine<br>
the religon of computers, c programming and everything working smoothly<br>
the moon is a clarifier<br>
that chasing after the illusion is apart of this hardship<br>
it is the reason it gives birth to a battle that seems insurmountable<br>
7 of wands<br>
being convicted of winning is apart of the problem~<br>
'being defiant, opposing all opposition'<br>
this is apart of the problems...<br>
<br>
the solutions to the problems are simply love<br>
2 of cups<br>
the lovers<br>
are connected cards<br>
love is the answer to the problems<br>
and union with a person or thing is apart of it<br>
which is hard to read, what am I forming a union with<br>
programming?<br>
c language?<br>
the final clarifier is card i see associatde with sofa<br>
a victorious person the triumph and glory<br>
ive noticed recently people dont need to see my vn to think highly of me<br>
im unsure what exactly the solution means<br>
if it means to not worry abt the engine<br>
and all my dreams<br>
that i can just focus on my relationship to sofa<br>
and theres happiness in that<br>
instead of try to force this miracle to happen with the code<br>
my skills and the love corp vn<br>
but i dont think i want to give it up<br>
<br>
i pulled queen of wands for myself again<br>
what i should give up is the feeling of powerlessness<br>
and oddly<br>
the thing I should focus on is the victim mindset<br>
which i read as the melodrama<br>
this is all about theatre after all<br>
this made me think that everything i envision is purely theoretical<br>
like baggins analytical machine, it worked, but it was never created<br>
it was revolutionary in many ways<br>
but the world wasnt ready for it<br>
and even when the world did build it <br>
there was better tools made to do the job<br>
so it was just a fantasy and intersting idea<br>
that was radical<br>
but unimagined<br>
melodrama<br>
im a dramatic person indeed<br>
im not sure what exactly that means tho in practice<br>
<br>
more cards i pulled on the elements im juggling<br>
the script: hanged man, 'letting go, emotional release'<br>
the 3d: tower 'a revelation, see thru illusions'<br>
the music: ace of wands 'courage, believe in yourself, masturbation'<br>
drawing: page of cups 'show drawing love, remember your dreams, be loving'<br>
and the code: ace of cups 'let heart lead the way'<br>
<br>
<br>
dont focus on: being powerless<br>
focus on: the drama, the tradegdy<br>
<br>
well this gives me the idea, all of this in mind,<br>
<br>
that i have to completely open my mind and heart<br>
become very intuitive<br>
and not obsess over holding onto things<br>
not obsess over problems<br>
if trying to make the 3d engine doesnt work<br>
i shoudln't hold onto it<br>
i need to focus on love as much as possible<br>
its ok to express ideas completely in theory<br>
like my writings that talk about particle effects what not<br>
those are valid writings as is without showing the real<br>
its ok to talk about the story as if it takes place in the 3d stage<br>
and describe things in 3d terms<br>
but its not a real 3d engine or real time rendering<br>
its just a story<br>
a poem.... a romantic ideal...<br>
<br>
<br>
clarifiers<br>
script.... knight of pentacles<br>
3d...... 3 of cups (3... and, not, or)<br>
music......6 of swords<br>
drawing.... king of wands<br>
code....4 of pentacles<br>
<br>
<br>
what to focus on today<br>
death reverse<br>
a new chapter and transition<br>
forget the old<br>
move into the new<br>
close the old doors<br>
to let in the new<br>
community is afoot<br>
love is in the air<br>
and today<br>
nonaction<br>
sofa<br>
letting things happen naturally<br>
just withdraw and chill<br>
take it easy<br>
passive<br>
waiting patiently<br>
ride the fate<br>
and new information is coming to me<br>
the answer is coming about the 'melodrama'<br>
