<h2>study notes from today.</h2><br>
its the super blue moon so I'm mostly anticpating a jam with the piano... but most of the day I focused on learning C programming~ taking myself to class etc~ I'm going to put some of my notes here because I'm not sure where else to document them (in a way that'd be memorable for myself)...<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>6/5 phi*phi = pi</i><br>
<br>
This is supposedly approximately accurate.<br>
I have looked at using golden ratio for resolutions before, but I dont remember it resonating very much~ maybe golden ratio was too widescreen.<br>
<br>
Today I got the 11x14 numbers from Melancholia I... This is said to encode the 51@51 slope of the giza pyramid... What all the numbers mean ultimately, it a mystery to me... But I'm intersted in using these numbers to see how they feel in terms of canvas..<br>
edit: I have a personal relationship with numbers... and geometry...<br>
If someone was to ask me what the significance was I don't think I can answer it...<br>
maybe its the same way sofa said it...<br>
"It's a vibe."<br>
<br>
the aespect ratio of 11x14 = 11:14 <br>
converted to pixels: <br>
14 = 1344<br>
11 = 1056<br>
<br>
I set up a boilerplate raylib program drawing a single image rendered out of blender~ a love corp hat that perfectly fills the screen... It's an interseting resolution, only slightly thinner (in terms of width) than 800x600... So I believe this window if fullscreened in a 4:3 monitor would have small black bars down the sides... I'm interested in the idea of a multiple window program that can be lived in with the desktop~ instead of promoting the idea of immersion with a fullscreen envrionment favoring an ecosystem of windows the user can layout how they feel comfortable... That's how I like to live on a widescreen monitor so this might be the solution to this problem.<br>
Everyone had widescreens... very few have 4:3 monitors... The only reason to use 4:3 is because it was the old standard and there's a boxyness to it. Something about the 11x14 however ticks the boxes in my brain about 'boxiness'... (Classic?) when viewed in portrait mode 11x14 feels more like a real page... perhaps it could serve well as a textbox that looks like a full page... Im thinking abt the text box being separate from the window viewer... so if 11x14 was a textbox, perhaps the window viewer could be a 14x11... this is yet to be decided what makes the most sense.... I like the largeness of an immediately translated 11x14 to pixels ~ it sits on my widescreen 2k resolution monitor well ~ natively speaking, I can clearly see whats being depicted ~ it's comfortable on my eyes~ 640x480 is special n all, the dreamcast etc, but it's very tiny on my screen native. I have't figured out how to make a raylib program fullscreen and stretch/scale... what a rant.<br>
more thoughts.<br>
using reader_name to get a rand seed.<br>
getting numbers from the so called 'meaningless' data from pointers / addresses.<br>
rolling a physical dice to get a seed value.<br>
a 6 dice with symbols: moon, star, heart, button, carrot,key.<br>
Cude octahedron.<br>
Grabbing numbers from an array based on conditions.<br>
If reader choses x, use first value in an array.<br>
If reader chooses y, user the second value in an array.<br>
Meditation. The scarab with its belly shown.<br>
Internet suggested there is only one known place you can see in ancient egypt where the scarab can be seen from underneath (exposed belly)~<br>
according to the shaman, this meant the place you're entering has all answers to the universe. <br>
This 'place' being the temple with the 'lightbulb'.<br>
It's an interesting effect.<br>
I saw the winged scarab's belly before I learned abt it's puported uniqueness.<br>
Scarab has a connection to the golden gate / gate of death. This made me think about The Golden Gate bridge not to far away from my apt. I wondered if I could find any scarabs there.<br>
<br>
GLFW transparent framebuffer is a possible lead to get transparent windows with raylib. I'm interested to see about starting an application that fades in and fades out on close.<br>
<br>
I think a game window that fades in is going to make a statement of difference compared to most windows that jarringly pop up ~ this is a small detail most likely don't care about~ but I personally do.<br>
<br>
Dissolves are everything in a VN I think to make it seem less jarring.<br>
<br>
I want a physical calculator.<br>
and a voice recorder.<br>
<br>
I'm not mentioning much I learned about programming in this diary. It's mostly boring basics.<br>
<br>
Someone at the cafe described the death of their brother as a 'glitch in the system.' This was a major turning point in their life.<br>
<br>
I personally don't see myself vetted to do number crunching... C is geared for it though. I'm learning math stuffs today only to get me through the chapters... I don't want to investigate polynomials that far.. nor magic squares... I just need to loosely understand them to learn the language. I don't think my VN engine will have much math invovled aside from the 3D stuff~ as far as I'm concerned, that math is already solved ~ it's just a matter of implimentation.<br>
<br>
The days are gone when math bosses discovered magic circles.<br>
<br>
I am curious to use magic squares for purpose of divination. I used the online calcuator to build one out of my birthday as well as sofas. Useful? Im not sure.<br>
<br>
Divinations and Computeres strongly interests me... I used to think it was fake and not real~ which is inherently true for RNG.... but there's that one theory that qi follows intention.... and intention can alter the effects of RNG.. is that really true?<br>
<br>
I'm gnna have to recheck that ish to double think it...<br>
I've experienced however, a real effect of intention + computer yielding interesting results~ I'm speaking purely in terms of making art with code... Supercollider is where I first discovered you can use intention to penetrate and make sonic discoveries~ perhaps those sonic discoveries are somehow interdimentional.... I always felt those frequencies had some sort of spatiality to them, describing spaces that 'dont exist' or do in ways I can only percieve with mind alone...<br>
<br>
Numbers don't seem to inherently exist to me right now~ yet numbers can be used to approximate things and be roughly accurate~ in other words, numbers are provisionary terms to help us understand the workings of the universe, but the actual energy behind everything are not numbers... numbers are made up.... but somehow, they work.<br>
<br>
C programming book spoke abt barcodes it reminded me of the game I played when little ~ where you scanned barcodes to find the monsters... I only saw the note now so I have to pull it up..<br>
<br>
<img src="https://lovecorp.neocities.org/pics/cap_526.png"><br>
I remember being rly into it as a kid... but I think the game lost the glow and charm after a period of time... perhaps scanning barcodes all day isn't really that fun...<br>
<br>
The ancestral lady computers giggle behind my backs as I read an introduction to C programming.<br>
This is their shit.<br>
<br>
My characters are evolving with me.<br>
I've only told sofa this because only she can be trusted with this level of confidential information.<br>
They've taken on the appearnce of elves now~ but I dont think its safe to call them elves... and they also are taking on the appearance of a royal family~ leaving behind the honest sea org uniform behind.<br>
It's not fully decided which is what~ I'm kinda in the middle... Sea Org uniforms is very honest about the real... and Royal Family is very real about the fake... I think the fake is going to be more fun for me to draw in the long run~ it's more assertive of my personality whereas being loyal to Sea Org is restrictive in alot of ways. Yet everything I study to imitate enters the style somehow~ the designs I have for royal family is not completely new... it still resembles love corp but with more fantasy elements.<br>
enough blabbing abt that.<br>
<br>
Divinations playing a role in solving a mystery.<br>
PCs as a divination tool.<br>
Divinations as a gameplay mechanic.<br>
These are interesting ideas to me.<br>
I thoguht abt a random tarot card commandline utility... but i dnno how truly useful thatd be since I have a real tarot deck + learn tarot... i could make it purely for my own interpretation... but u know... time will tell.<br>
