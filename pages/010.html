 danny is a load off <br>
 alot <br>
 my hands back <br>
 altho the occasional hurt here n there <br>
 i find myself addressing the ish still <br>
 putting ish online is messy for me <br>
 i dont have the same relationship i used to <br>
 writing random diary shit sure whatever <br>
 i had to put tarot away because it only goes so far <br>
 so far as, i can get alot of concepts from it <br>
 but those concepts aren't going to elaborate on themselves <br>
 tarot isn't a shortcut <br>
 in the end, i put the deck away because I need to give myself room to breathe <br>
 im writing a story and the story needs freedom <br>
 or, it asked me for more freedom... <br>
 freedom to not think in terms of what others do <br>
 the danger of consuming all this art <br>
 to get all these ideas of what can be done <br>
 i dont want to settle my mind on any of those <br>
 so angel tell me <br>
 just be yourself and naturally the 'originality' comes thru <br>
 i rambled abt originality being dependant on the obscurity of yr sources <br>
 but that doesn't take personal experience into consideration <br>
 the good the bad and ugly <br>
 yesterday i was spiraling into negative thoughts on the toilet <br>
 typical, everything sucks, im delusional, anxiety of 'jack of all trades, master of none' <br>
 that shit i dont believe in <br>
 ill tell u what I do believe in tho <br>
 is that Prince is one of my angels <br>
 the most recent flavor i've gotten from him is a simple saying <br>
 'more more more, i want to see more of you' <br>
 not to say, prince wants to look at me <br>
 but i just think abt how much of prince he brought to the table <br>
 he asked 'more more more' of himself  <br>
 theres no need to deny yrself <br>
 or... you dont have to less less less... <br>
 so i think abt 'moremoremore' in the context of making art <br>
 taking a bite of all the fruits on the tree <br>
 fondling every branch <br>
 and im worried I can't bring the amount of me I want to bring <br>
 its not sane to doubt oneself <br>
 then people will say ur delusional if ur dreams are too big <br>
 if its all rely on probabilities <br>
 im just waiting for the lottery win pullin the john <br>
 <br>
 Effie is an old character of mine... <br>
 shes made a heavy comeback... <br>
 i like her more than debbie...twig's LA mom... <br>
 she was just a typical american religious mom on the fence. <br>
 Effie is fully indoctrinated... <br>
 shes fully fantasy abt it too... <br>
 theres no projection of the american mom into her <br>
 not in a direct or easy to draw way <br>
 ig ive given myself permission to be more evil <br>
 and the characters level up <br>
 the world that ive been living in <br>
 i wrote it down by hand to feel it... <br>
 ill transcribe it a little right now... <br>
 <br>
 I saw it... <br>
 the dense fog resting over the land barely detailing <br>
 the outer facade of a dense forest.   <br>
 That old shanty burned down like me. <br>
 Twigs wanted Comma to know she has a penis~ <br>
 the best way was to show it straight in the unexpected moment <br>
 by lifting her dress in the entry to the front double doors <br>
 she lifted her skirt and showed comma <br>
 the secret in the best way possible: direct education <br>
 comma's response was no response~ <br>
 not a single flicker in the eye to give any inkling of assumption. <br>
 Yet, you could say his stoic confront without waiver is in a sense  <br>
 his way of expressing approval... <br>
 However, he has no personal allegance to whatever he be approving of. <br>
 to what favor? <br>
 He said every detail to the superiors~ <br>
 Mother and Father in the same room right in front of her as they inspected her wounds. <br>
 She had been missing for three months. <br>
 This type of event wasn't scripted... <br>
 or it was unclear... at the time,  <br>
 it was before the family signed the agreement to also participate in the super-festival <br>
 the landscape of the 'royal' life was much different back then <br>
 more timid and frugal <br>
 but work the family did, just not at the high volumes it does today.. <br>
 the affluence that never ends <br>
   <br>
   "fish where the fish bite." <br>
   This is the single word of advice step-uncle shared Pu'er... <br>
   and the rest is history? <br>
 <br>
 mtg is calling me again <br>
 but is it rly rly? <br>
 like rly gnna what play that ish all day or what <br>
 drop big buckz on them decks <br>
 <br>
 havent read any ish abt c programming all week <br>
 been busy with cleaning <br>
 blackdresses mv <br>
 drawing <br>
 and writing just raw story <br>
 book sits on the desk anyways <br>
 taking my sweet time ig <br>
 no rush <br>
 its also not the major problem to solve <br>
 apart of me thinks <br>
 shits gnna get real when i finish the novel <br>
 which is how im treating it now <br>
 im just gnna write this new version as a novel <br>
 dnno if I can even say theres a name for it <br>
 but theres a reality to the place <br>
 i feel it <br>
 its tangile <br>
 i can travel there potently <br>
 prolly never getting into mtg again like i used to <br>
 unless sofa wanted to get into it.... <br>
 3d prog course calling me <br>
 so is just the classes <br>
 been hard to juggle it all <br>
 so im just floating in the ether <br>
 maryanne amacher talked abt 'imaginary music' <br>
 thats the music you imagine by listening to the 'real' <br>
 and i experienced this alot with my own /f music <br>
 often times, i hear songs that could be, or would be <br>
 but aren't really existing <br>
 the elements are there, or if there *was* structure, <br>
 it's not given to the ears without imaginary work <br>
 i relate to her alot <br>
 I would become bored to focus only on a single thing <br>
 but programming still a total mystery to me <br>
 cant afford to blow on the graphix course rn <br>
 so gnna just wait <br>
 and 'bang my head against the wall' <br>
 /f mixtape on slsk alrdy <br>
 dnno even who get or how many dls <br>
 im avoiding searching things <br>
 and avoid rly make contact with fans too <br>
 their opinions and those random passerbyers with opinions <br>
 life been more peaceful without the noise <br>
 still an internet girl <br>
 typing... <br>
 thinking... <br>
 posting... <br>
 logging in...logging out... <br>
 chewing on altoids... <br>
 nothing interesting happening here. <br>
 just existing. <br>
 been drawing sprites or attempt to figure out designs <br>
 i have a new one for twigs/ecchia <br>
 which seems more like a uniform for all SisterDaughers <br>
 and theres the maid uniform, that all maids have to wear <br>
 and what else,... i have a concept for effie <br>
 but its slowburn <br>
 need to do mv work next week <br>
 thats the most urgent deadline based creative ish rn <br>
  <br>
  associative thinking <br>
  no wonder she was put on my radar <br>
  like healing apple <br>
  the thoughts of john zorn been coming alot <br>
  specifically 'all hallows eve 2' being a frequency <br>
  i feel suits the place ive been travelling <br>
  apophenia castle <br>
  guess mama gnna be doin them midi strings soon <br>
  i personally dont value my /f work anymore <br>
  ig because its 'bread and butter' <br>
  im just not focused on it like i was <br>
  burnt <br>
  taking a real break <br>
  my hands need it too <br>
  piano drew me in so intense <br>
  and the playing style i developed <br>
  perhaps a troublesome habit <br>
  i bang out and make myself a monkey <br>
  thoughts of death <br>
  not to untomyself <br>
  but often thinking abt death <br>
  seems normal <br>
  that gettin older <br>
  ur getting closer to it <br>
  and its gnna happen <br>
  thats a strange thought to settle in my mind <br>
  like ok, its really gonna happen to me someday <br>
  i have to face that threshold <br>
  its not a fantasy <br>
  or a story or a symbol  <br>
  but its not my time now <br>
  at least <br>
  i dont think it is <br>
  i dont feel my time is near <br>
  near to die <br>
  the only person who say they like my big posts is sofa <br>
  so at least one person vibe with me <br>
  but we ridin so u know <br>
  its like that <br>
