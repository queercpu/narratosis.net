I think (with some reservation) I'd like to take the 3D Computer Graphics Programming course... (https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming) <br>
 <br>
(now im sold) <br>
anon nokturnal rekommended it <br>

  <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/007/cap_553.png"><br>
 <br>
nok says using switchs and ifs to dictate game states is the 'traditional way' <br>
and the way they suggest... is via custom stackhandlers <br>
tbh, i might have to try the traditional way first because <br>
thats probably all I can reasonably wrap my headaround <br>
 <br>
thats when i learned abt VVVVVV (howevermany) source code <br>
and the one anon said "the main has a 3000+ switch statement" <br>
 <br>
 <br>
the reason traditional way is 'bad' they said is cuz it makes <br>
main loops hard to read... <br>
ok... <br>
rn gnna snack tho <br>
 <br>

game of life <br>
ego <br>
a shatter program. <br>
viva and twigs <br>
at the beach, where the slums of apophenia rise high up <br>
that aztec stairway of grass leading up to the  <br>
sailor memorial <br>
in the distance <br>
the light bridge that leads to the oil rig <br>
completely shrouded in fog <br>
pipelines and machinery puppet carts  <br>
hauling tons of raw goods  <br>
it's a one way street <br>
 <br>
TWIGS <br>
 <br>
VIVA <br>

EGO <br>
i feel strongly abt ego <br>
i realized why i like andrew hussie <br>
because they came up with their own language <br>
 <br>
 <br>
i can make only what i know <br>
rn my art is nothing more than bg sprite and text with a default font <br>
i can make a cprogram thats nothing more than a single scene <br>
not even 'real' single thing<br>
 <br>
no menu <br>
no save <br>
just a single scene <br>
with a splash <br>
thats like a tv show lol <br>
i thought the final product would be a string of c programs <br>
a collection <br>
my hands feel a little cranky <br>
gnna do something else for a sec <br>
make ego title <br>
 <br>
ladylove<3 <br>
i remember <br>

 <br>
game programming gems 5... <br>
the gems series does interest me ~~ <br>
minesweeper tut on raylib gnna do eventually <br>
if i do any game its that one <br>
 <br>
 these old XXX dos games brought me joy...<br>
 i remember play when i was very lil<br>

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

sofa asked me to make an exe of my tarot program <br>
but i wasnt able to <br>
 <br>
apart of me wants to rebel against windows <br>
and refuse to build for it <br>
sorry! <br>
if u want to 'play my game' (that doesnt even exist) <br>
u should consider migrating to linux <br>
its a much better OS <br>
and dont worry abt leaving yr AAA games behind <br>
you dont even need them <br>
do u ? <br>
i dnno <br>
.... <br>
gamers <br>
I bitch at you when I walk to the cafe and ramble to myself<br>
you don't even exist...<br>
and by not exist I mean, you aren't really existing in my life<br>
just a construct paper machette doll of my fringe fantasies.<br>
 <br>
id prolly be fine without them <br>
i learned my lesson when the nerdherd excommunicated me the first time in hs <br>
 <br>
regularlly hallucinating blow and carmack smiling at the computers <br>
its the only way we communicate <br>
they are over the horizon <br>
smiling at me <br>
no actually we are smiling at the computer...<br>
we all smiling at the screen<br>
that's why we can smile at eachother<br>
but we can't really look at eachother..<br>

hovering faces on the skyline <br>
when i want to talk abt those quotes.. <br>
i don thave the evil ones <br>
the hard dark confused ancient dragon ones <br>
 <br>
alphasmart my fave place to write <br>
i prefer it than vim <br>
vim fucking rocks for coding <br>
 <br>

  <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/007/cap_581.png"><br>
  I rambled abt this artist but I deleted it cuz bad juju.<br>
  I just am happy to see some old gay women art.........<br>
 <br>
just hallucinating music <br>
poweirng thru rn <br>

thinking abt psyhic detective series again... <br>
orgel... <br>
 <br>
a journal... <br>
AYA....BGM.... <br>
the reality <br>
i cant even make a single window game lol <br>
 <br>
so what am i trippin over what a diff one could like <br>
gotta at least get a super simple one <br>
widescreen just makes me tiffed <br>
wanting to solve it <br>
wanting to go against it <br>
 <br>
ricing my i3 ish today and xterm <br>
goodbye kitty? <br>
js sayin bye to that strawberry term ish lol <br>
xterm feels solid <br>
just a vibe <br>
 <br>
"omegalawl" <br>
 <br>
i thoguth abt sonic adventure again as well <br>
i had a new idea for a vn as well <br>
or a mood <br>
but... i haven't breakthru yet <br>
theres like <br>
no way i can escape the big universe <br>
its just so complicated <br>
i thought abt starting with the LA story again <br>
thoughts abt my parental shit flaring up <br>
and my psychosis gnna study like i said i would <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/007/cap_568.png" width=640><br>
five elemtsn <br>
music <br>
programming <br>
drawing <br>
writing <br>
3d <br>
 <br>
i have to focus on these at different times <br>
 <br>
(and notice how im terrible at putting 'well being' & 'mental/physical health' nowhere on that list so much for 'balance') <br>
 <br>
3d I'm not that worried abt <br>
(then you forget abt yrself) <br>
 <br>
 <br>
for (;;) <br>
 <br>
"in seeking the unattainable, simplicity only gets in the way" <br>
 <br>
 <br>
when twigs joins the love corp <br>
she goes to work at the Bluebase <br>
where is the bluebase? <br>
its down apophenia blvd in the entertainment district <br>
i think apophenia is the main city <br>
theres a large church there <br>
and theres also a huge tower thats the royal family tower <br>
hatym lives on the ship <br>
pu'er is also on the ship too <br>
but he goes to apophenia to deal with business <br>
and gets special treatment at BB ~ and gets to see his daughter uzi. <br>
i learned today that twigs is adopted..? <br>
her mom was supposed to have had her in the love corp at age 16 <br>
but mom is a fake..and her ex-husband steve is also a fake (human) <br>
twigs is a rela <br>
because she's actually a member of the royal family playing the character twigs <br>
so her ears stick out and its confusing <br>
to me at least <br>
i know that the real mother to twigs is the flower <br>
 <br>
 <br>
the problem of mass popular <br>
people start to think the art product is a democracy <br>
but if u keep it small <br>
then u can do things originally and freely <br>
i think doom3 flashlight as they originally intended made sense and was cool <br>
but oh no the gamers made their voices heard <br>
itwas the political move to say 'sorry' and add a fix... <br>
democracy......... <br>
sign the petition to get mass effect 3 ending impeeched! <br>
but no... <br>
thats not the relationship i want to have with my art <br>
where fans and gamers and consumers can just project their desires  <br>
or their worst fears............ <br>
 <br>
if you dont like it <br>
then find something else <br>
if you cant satisfy yr senses with other peoples art u shoul dprobably be making yr own art <br>
so u can do something abt it the endless dissatissfaction <br>
or is it unfortunet for you <br>
that you wind up in the 'even making art is fuel for disasstisfaction' <br>
everyone wants to make game <br>
everyone isn't satisifed <br>
endless hunger <br>
 <br>
HALT <br>
am i hungry <br>
not rly <br>
am i angry <br>
maybe a lil? <br>
am i lonely? <br>
no <br>
am i tired? <br>
maybe <br>
 <br>
