i can vouch for the 11x14 ratio <br>
testing it only on a few sketches so far <br>
i came up with the pentagram with 5 symbols to constitute my practice.. <br>
moon: music (broadly speaking, frequency)<br>
carrot: trad art, drawing, painting <br>
yinyang: programming, true/false, 0/1 <br>
cross: 3D <br>
heart: script, writing <br>
 <br>
the colors are significant to the symbols <br>
with exception of carrot <br>
I'm not sure if green/orange reflect anything inherently special <br>
about painting and drawing.  It's through the association of Cawa perhaps <br>
who drew carrots with colored pencils... <br>
 <br>
blue and yellow have always had a connection to me <br>
about spiritual... and moon... and music... <br>
heart makes sense to be pink and red. <br>
its just love. <br>
3d i tend to associate with 'geometry green' which is a laser neon color <br>
the purple being its spiritual connection  <br>
i tend to think of purple being a spiritual color <br>
perhaps a 'real' color <br>
real I learned in the dictionary has an obscure definition of being<br>
"a royal person"<br>
ofc this made me shout out "its a coicidence"<br>
because real and royal are connected<br>
yinyang is obviously black and white <br>
programming is very black and white <br>
its only complex through an illusion <br>
0 and 1s..... thats really what it comes down to. <br>
the pentagram is red because I don't know what else to color it <br>
this is an image made for purpose of sigil magic <br>
so i felt red is iconic / typical for a sigil... <br>
inft potential said the number 1 rule abt magick is to never talk about it<br>
woops<br>
in the center is the eye <br>
i typically associated the eye with 3D <br>
because the camera is an EYE that sees.. <br>
also ofc, eye is associated with drawing, because it's a visual sense <br>
but the eye was left out of this final drawing <br>
consulting one of the older freemason symbols <br>
there's a circular shape in the middle that could represent an eye <br>
so I lifted that for this... <br>
observer experiences all of these 5 things. <br>
the star can be associated with the senses of the body. <br>
eye ~ visual ~ painting <br>
ear ~ sonic ~ music <br>
skin ~ tactile ~ 3D <br>
nose ~ olfactory ~ script <br>
tongue ~ taste ~ yinyang  <br>
 <br>
i feel heart is more explicitly linked to writing <br>
but just to squeeze things in, i felt nose was the best <br>
because it's about following your nose which is linked to heart <br>
and instincts... <br>
 <br>
yinyang, taste, makes me think about tea <br>
so code and tea I think is an interesting combination to be  <br>
grouped together. <br>
taste... coding about taste... <br>
and Im thinking taste not only in terms of flavor <br>
but as in preferences. <br>
 <br>
skin makes me think about casing for a body. <br>
3D is where I'm putting skin.. <br>
that could be translated to flesh. <br>
and it just seems appropriate to associate a cross to flesh. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 the real question for me is<br>
 if its worth halving the 11x14<br>
it's more in line with 'dreamcast'<br>
672x528<br>
VS<br>
640x480<br>
.......<br>
<h2>its so cute.</h2><br>
so much time i have spent obsessing over resolutions<br>
here's a mock up in gimp ~ 11:14 ratio.<br>
<img src="https://lovecorp.neocities.org/pics/11x14%20mock.png"><br>
I'm curious to try a separate window for textbox...<br>
but this will do for now...<br>
it's small...<br>
its unclear if raylib will provide a decent way to resize screen based on user preference but also retain the originality of the base resolution<br>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/JeffM2501/00cf5653f41337d8c9e8db40deb25656"><br>
their example<br></a> for fullscreen resizing I personally found to be very destructive<br>
it literally scales the whole screen<br>
the mouse becomes blurry and weird<br>
It doesn't seem to be the answer<br>
so if a game is never meant to be played in fullscreen...these issues wont matter<br>
apart of the appeal of multiple windows comes from my recent experiences with Ultima Online<br>
that game gives users a big canvas with all these floating windows that one can arrange how they please<br>
I really enjoyed that design... since I like to laythings out according to preference...<br>
this is a primary motive to see if VN will fit this design idea...<br>
that users can layout the elements according to their preference...<br>
in stead of provide a base canvas, the windows will just appear or go away if desired<br>
as it stands, the only windows that matter are the Viewer window and the Text box...<br>
I thought a commandline would be interesting....<br>
and you could also include a clock/calender ~ just examples<br>
I have some windows that'd typically be accessed through buttonn in a renpy game.<br>
org board.... glossary...<br>
these *could* be separate windows like inventory bag...<br>
it sounds like the problem would be coding little chibi programs and the final program is a collection of chibis....<br>

<br>
<br>
I attempted to make a 'big bang' scene...<br>
creating it in blender wasn't very gratifying to my senses<br>
<img src="https://lovecorp.neocities.org/pics/dongbang1.png"><br>
my vision tho... is to render it in real time...<br>
i'll see wussup..<br>
raylib can handle animations if I could get even a basic idle animation that would be<br>
FLEXXXXXXXX for me<br>
but gtta keep myslf grounded<br>
cant even do shit yet<br>
big bang is to represent the birth of a universe<br>
so I'd like it to be as significant as possible<br>
"gratifying the senses"~ I can't be tricked or fooled<br>
<br>
i love calc ~ just found out u can do c expressions with it....heartbeat!<br>
dnno if a physi one can do that......<br>
1%3<br>
being a drop out from hs don't help my anxiety that I'm a *sucker*losser* re: math<br>
tryna over come it.....<br>
