<h2>Revelations (I lost track of the number)<br></h2>
I took in a little more C from the book..<br>
I find myself able to describe with more clarity what a custom VN engine could look like.<br>
Now what makes me worried in a way, but also relieved, I struggle to know what exactly I'm making.<br>
I think the simplest description of what I'm envisioning is a universe I can throw eveything at ~ it's a story that never begins and never ends..<br>
to represent my own life in terms of code, <br>
IsJasmine = 1<br>
this reflects the fact I am living... standing on my own two feet.<br>
what would the use of a variable like this be in a custom engine? <br>
CameraRolling = 1<br>
<br>
Taking on the specatcles of 'ancient dragons' I recieved alot of messages today.<br>
<br>
The world is made up of 3 (technically 4) dimentions that depend on the hardware of a readers PC.<br>
<br>
The source code is the highest level. or the lowest level existance of the dimentions... Perhaps this could be likened to the Elevator concept that Hatym uses for her Religion.<br>
<br>
The story how the Love Corp became the world's most powerful religion ~ the drama of getting legalization/ state recognition, when the royal family made it the state religion... when goverment merged with religion to rule the NPCs.<br>
<br>
The story is a movie and a theatrical production. It is a movie that is shot on a stage in a studio that is in the EntertainMent district Los Apophenia. aka.. the city of demons.<br>
<br>
The story has the cast of characters who are played by their actors... Since characters are merely placeholder terms, actors can play more than one character... and actors can play characters of different gender, as well as species, race etc... through use of make up, costume, and kigurumi... actors can take on role of any character... <br>
<br>
The story is a propaganda film, that is meant to be seen through the lens of a believer, a film that is like a Scientology event video...with the booming voice, it's very much living in the reality of the literature, from the eyes of a cultist... Twigs Trollop is the one character who tries to leave... Twigs Trollop is a character who is played by Actor Lyla Novatrek... These are two components out of three.<br>
<br>
The realm of the story, theatrical production, movie eye. All actors play characters. This is a propaganda film about how Love Corp tries to overcome their hardships in getting recognition, but fails and in a crash and burn story. everyone dies. The jesus christ of the love corp in a way. <br>
<br>
The realm of the world. Apophenia Entertainment District, Actors are people who live in the city ~ these actors are the royal family who are the state religion and state goverment. In reailty, the Love Corp is the worlds most powerful organization in the universe. They are about to unleash their tech onto the whole world ~ genocide, mass concentration camps~ all of these dramas are 'real world' dramas as the actors/royal family work together to finish shooting the film...<br>
<br>
The film ends with a a big crash and burn as well... <br>
<br>
The movie and the real world are blurred lines for a reason but they represnent 'fake and real' in provision terms.<br>
<br>
There is the third element of the universe, a third dimention, that is the server side, the source code, the engine that makes all of these two stories,realities happen. The characters played by actors are represented in the sourcecode as the Driving Functiosnof the program. The scenedirector, the cameraDirector(), SoundDirector(), PageManager(), these are code entities that represent the actors in an abstract sense. they also have unique names... <br>
If it's not that, there are meaningless statements representing them.<br>
but they aren't meaningless.<br>
then what are they<br>
originally, they were the moderators.<br>
I have to dig up that old paper again that detailed everything along side a dreamcast mobo..<br>

<br>
Twigs / Lyla Novatrek/ Veronica.<br>
twigs trollop, a character in a movie<br>
lyla novatrek, an actor apart of the royal family<br>
veronica, a code block entity, a function, who has control over the universe at a high level/low level.<br>
(just a moderator, the sister daughters system places a real role. SDRAM.<br>
SUPER-FESTIVAL OF THE MOVIE-GAMES<br>
<br>
The sister daugher wife system.<br>
SDWS<BR>
<br>
wife being highest rank (a function to the pimp in the code ~ a harem story)<br>
sister being 2nd in rank (a sister to a king and queen, the royal family story)<br>
daughter being lowest in rank (a daughter to the holy mother, a story of a cult)<br>
<br>
<h2>
the name of the game is EGO<br></h2>
<i>it never begins<br>
it never ends<br>
it starts right here<br>
and flunks right now<br>
<br></i>
beginning, it never has a beginning because it's ending is the same as the ending. The snake eats it's own tail.<br>
Snakey has sex with itself.<br>
It also starts right here, a place fixated in time that is a present moment. It can't end because it's started.<br>
and it flunks right now, it fails to pass the test, thus is cannot end.<br>
It flunks when it starts<br>
it starts when it flunks<br>
it ends where it begins<br>
and it begins where it ends<br>
EGO<br>
a game of control <br>
and a game of unification to God, the original creator<br>
EGO is a game that was born out of fractions of an original creator, the original creator has subdivided into separate pieces, each subdevision created another layer of complexity.<br>
<br>
There are four levels of beingness.<br>
The lowest level, in terms of abberation, is the story inside the story. Love Corp characters endure hardship.<br>
The second Level, apophenia, beings are powerful members of a royal family... They enter the state of fantasy and reality on command, also according to a script. They are not attatched to the movie in a viewer way... They have their own life and think the story is 'just a story'. Client-Side. <br>
The third level, is serverside... that is abstract. it's an interdimentional realm. All actors have representation and existance on the server side. they can travel and navigate and exist on the server side. its through the server side hacking can occur, the commandland, etc, are apart of it... characters can break the rules, get access to 'god mode' and get 'infinity weapons bullets' etc... they can travel and teleport.. bi-locate, and do things that break the 'game' story...<br>
<br>
the fourth floor is the higest known level.<br>
correction;;;;; hardware 'exists' on third floor.<br>
the hardware itself that exists on a computer.<br>
CPU, GPU, RAM, MOBO, these entities reprsent gods / great spirits that the lowest beings have to be subservient to... show respect too... they live as guests on a computer...<br>
the fifth / fourth floor is the unknowable realm.<br>
OP. OVERRIDING PARADOX.<br>
that's the 'realm of the reader' the realm of the observer... the realm of the administrator. a unknowable force that drivesthings into being or unbeing... the thing that pushes play on the start button... that is something that cannot be known..<br>
when the actors live on the screen<br>
they are thankful to the gods who pushed the button that let them xist<br>
thats the reader<br>
but perhaps the reader will never get that confirmed<br>
because the actors cannot know who the reader really is<br>
they can only speak towards it<br>
but not understand what they are speaking to<br>
ig it puts readers, a user, in a subjective role of being a God... who has ability to destroy and create life at will...<br>
but also is unable in some regards to control everything... life has a life of its own because it's subdivided. <br>
the author is the creator in a story sense.<br>
thats me... in a real sense<br>
but in a fake sense its sunday blue who was imprisioned for 1 billion years to a max security prison<br>
this is a prison that was duplicated and scattered across a planet to be run in multiple, decentralized locatiosn to serve the sentence with interest, multiple instances of a prison sentence don't make the sentence go quicker, it's necessary to pay the sentence interest and be net positive i.e. the setence term goes down a day at a time at the rate of a regular clock rather than stagnate or increase....<br>
<br>
These are many of the ideas that I believe are essential to the world building of this VN i'm eager to complete.<br>
<br>
I think it's important for artists to deeply quesiton tried and true methods. Or... if it's not about building the wheel again... I think it's healthy to question why we have constructs like 'novel' and 'movie' and 'game'... these are worth questioning... why do we have save and load... why do we have music albums... <br>
<br>
For myself, I've been asking myself all these quesiton, trying to ask things as low as possible~ to whatever seems reasonable... I've gone so far to investigate C programming... doing away with thinking Renpy is worth using to make the statement.<br>
<br>
I dont think what I'm making is a game... so I dont think save and load will be necessary... I'm thinking about it like a book with chapters... <br>
<br>

<br>
in terms of engine structure, I have some loose ideas how it would work~ the first version I'm labeling v0.1 <br>
the milestones for v0.1 would be a simple 2D vn engine.. it takes scripts as inputs, parses/code generates/ and passes that information to a Director who allocates that information to the various functions that handle sound, sprites, bg, overlay etc.. <br>
I have to find a way to implement a PageManager as well to make sure assetts are loaded and unloaded appropriately... blabla.. I think v0.1 is about the basic structure that I'll build upon to approach v0.5<br>
<br>
v0.5 i think milestones is convert the 2d into 3d. They wont look that different because the stage is an orthographic camera looking at layers of planes... the only difference is the engine will have access to the planes as separate objects instead of drawing 2d textures to a window... so I think there'll be interesting experimentation to happen here.<br>
<br>
three types of scenes, if I'm really letting loose.<br>
1. the stage... where most the story happens. actors are on a stage.<br>
2. behind the stage, backstage, these are explorable envrionments simple, first person, hallways, server side places.<br>
3. objectscene... this is just an empty space with a single 3d object.<br>
<br>
although, the stage would represent where the lowest level story happens, the stage is also necessary to talk about actors as they exist in apophenia. so the stage can travel dimenstions as well. these are both 'stories' with the distinction, the characters and story says they are different places.<br>
<br>
the 3d envrionments might be the only real behind the scenes, server side stuff.<br>
<br>
object style is a nonexisting location, just to show objects, the contract, the crossaint, any 3d model of importance for the readers to inspect.<br>
<br>
A big part of the story is giving the reader the task of solving the riddles of the story. So the sphinx gives a riddle... the answe rto the riddle can be put into a commandline. results?<br>
<br>
Tarot didnt say I will be able to execute any of this persay... but it didn't say Im not going to. it seemed to say, you will be writing alot, because it's a hard grind.<br>
<br>
Tarot def said... Love is essnetial.<br>
and melodrama, that's apart of what this is all about.<br>
<br>
theres a chance all of this is purely world building concepts... not to be really existing.<br>
it could be purely a script<br>
and the engine is purely 'made up'<br>
but i want the engine to be real<br>
i feel<br>
that would be the greatest celebration of life to gratify my senses<br>
and the best justice to my story and characters<br>
but who knows how long itll take<br>
im not giving up.<br>
