<br>
that means juss goin down by the river where the duckies hang out ~ we feast and draw and relax. <br>
saturday.  <br>
ig today is a day off. <br>
I had ideas at the duckies. <br>
One thing I percieve clear in my conciousness today is I'm glad I changed recently ~ that change being I no longer hold myself to an infinite obligation to overcome a creative problem.  Or I can rephrase it as... theres many ways I think I can say it... When I uninstalled renpy from my mind it wasn't a statement of giving up or cancelling my art... but there was a change of attitude about 'final products' and 'delivering something on time'...  I was holding myself to these expectations~ placed upon myself~ that were unreasonable to be attained in the given time~ if they were attainable then I'd be able to say I finished it... but 'it' what is exactly it I'm trying to finish?  It's more than just a game or a software 1.0 milestone.. I have to bring myself back to my original state often because I get carried away easily.  I'm just an artist and my game of life is to make art, to grow and to learn along the way.  Dali said if you want to make a masterpiece, don't sit down and try to make it... you have to just paint over and over until naturally it comes~ in other words, he says, if you want to make a masterpiece, it has to come to you... You can't dictate when that arrival happens, so you're best saving your brain powers not fixating on it... I have fallen victim to this mindset many times, growing fixated on achieving a 'masterpiece', but luckily it doesn't consume me to the point of no return...  I presume all artists understand this on some level...  <br>
 <br>
 I tried to dig up the precise quote Dali used... because I'm pulling his statement from memory.. I'm sure he said something along the lines in his book 50 secrets of magic...<br>
 however, at this time, I'm too lazy to scan every word of his first few chapeters so this is the main takeaway~ since I think it's in the same lane of the unrealized flower.<br>

 <br>
 
So recently I feel I let go of trying to obtain the masterpiece or.....THE ONE...  Since then I don't care if I amount to anything or not.  Or... I can make peace with the idea of not achieving anything or producing anything significant for the world to recieve.  I think I have a gift and a unique voice~ but in the words of Nina Simone: Everyone has a story to tell. <br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/quotes/ninasimone_story.png"><br>
 <br>
Although I think these thoughts to myself that, I'm not trying to amount to anything, that doesn't mean I stop dreaming... <br>
 <br>
At the duckies I had some ideas about how I can try to have an early win with C programming. <br>
 <br>
My first goal is to get a simple text story on the commandline... just click to advance text.  That's the rawest most basic product I want to accomplish in near future...  I expanded upon it  alittle more because I have the ideas fresh off the tree. <br>
 <br>
I drew out a call-center game at the duckies.  I probably shouldn't call it a game because it's not a game to win... but there's a number pad you can input numbers too... each day Twigs is given a list of names and numbers she has to call as apart of her work assignment in the love corp... Id like raylib to play just basic ambience and if I can figure out how to draw multiple windows I'd like to experiment.  I thought, this could be a very simple program to do some creative writing and also put all of my sea org writings to some immediate creative use.  But the feature leak is real with this one considering I don't know how to impliment anything yet aside from understanding on paper~ I still have yet to learn C properly~ but in due time~ so far it seems easy to learn or, each day I feel closer to being able to attain something. <br>
 <br>
John Carmack said something that stood out to me... about using local known data to advance in small increments is how you reach larger milestones in the long run~ he said he noticed this in other geniuses~ this method being functional...   <br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/quotes/john_carmack_loaclinfo.png"><br>
 <br>
The assets I'd have to make for a mini call-center game would be... <br>
1. the script, which is mostly finished because I already wrote it. ✓<br>
2. a call-center ambience..If I want music/sfx those are already made. <br>
3. a simple cg of the call center desk.  I made a sketch at the duckies, as well as a sketch of the forest,,, because I imagined Twigs hallucinating a scene of ducks and trees~ representing her desire to be somewhere else. <br>
4. a small phone num pad users can click on to dial numbers.✓ <br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/img/phone_pad.png"><br>
5. a list of names and numbers, either raw text on the terminal or displayed on a main window.  It could also be a separate window like a legal sheet~ I also imagined a calendar and also just a poster~ a propaganda event flier that has no purpose other than to decorate the scene. <br>
 <br>
I also imagined a small box window that is a gold frame where characters speaking would appear only as a headshot.  But this is really pushing the outer limits of what I'm immediately capable of doing right now. <br>
 <br>
The current name for the 'elves' are the 'reals' ~ and I don't know if they could be accurately classified as elves anyways because they also have sharp teeth~ but aren't vampires.  I think sofa is right in saying that animal is just cute. <br>
 <br>
 I do have an obsession with the temperature of the lighting in Sea Org spaces... Although I can't say I clearly remember what exactly the temperature was (hot or cold) ~ I just remember it being an opressive highlight of the life<br>
 I frequently remember or think about how the harshness of the bulbs affected a scene... and drew harsh shadows across the faces...<br>
 perhaps it was yellow~ i have only one photograph of a sea org member in CC~ it was very yellow picture~ but my white balance could have been super off<br>
 <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_539.png" width=640><br>
 #yellow<br>
 I'm going to investigate this photo further~<br>
 in past I was obsessed with pb60 having to represent everything<br>
 but that wasn't working out with ease<br>
 yellow is kinda disgusting feeling and seems appropriate for the roach n that<br>
 in the propaganda posters, the blue is always used as a scifi highlight~ the lens flare~ atm Im not sure how to create those so it's something I need to look into<br>
 <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_542.png"><br>
 <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_540.png"><br>
 it's something i'd say is heavily used and abused for Sea Org promo.......<br>
 <br>

 <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/phone_pad1.png"><br>
 I think even though subtle, the difference of temperature do add alot to the moods.....<br>
 Im kinda thinking abt matrix too~<br>
 i bet their master shots were probably super green /yellow<br>
 <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_545.png"><br>
  <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_546.png"><br>
   <img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_547.png"><br>
 def lol<br>
 some scenes more blue tho (like the dvd cover)~ I just strongly associate green yellow with matrix<br>
<br>
tried makin my own lens flare but needs some tinkering to put in the back pocket~<br>
it is an essential effect I want for Love Corp tho<br>
it's precisely because of that clique effect or something<br>
it's the try hard to be scifi and cool or whatever u call it<br>
sea org promotional pictures I might be short on words for it<br>
but because they use the lensflare so much.. I know they are trying to present a world view<br>
its like, romantic..<br>
Makes me think if marines / navy ads are using similar tricks... but I don't really have memory of that<br>
gnna look<br>
<a href="https://womenmarines.wordpress.com/2020/07/06/recruiting-women-marines-2/"> WOMEN MARINES WORDPRESS</a><br>
This is a good set of references<br>
and not a single lens flare can be found.....<br>
however...<br>
nobody (just talking to myself here) is surprised Sea Org took direct influence from marines.<br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_092.png"><br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_548.png"><br>
Sea Org feels like Navy Fan Fiction~cosplay <br>
the paramilitary dress and cosplay is really hard to let go in the name of purely fantasy (uniform design woe)<br>
I suppose I just personally find military uniforms sexy~ I suppose in a similar way Tom of Finland found uniforms sexy...<br> <h2>It's the unintended sexiness....?</h2><br>
by unintended... those who are gone in the cosplay aren't thinking it's sexy in the way I am projecting<br>
but sea org members were expected to be sexy~ at least the women..<br>
makeup and being pretty was apart of uniform<br>
so I think, there's some primal part of uniform that strives for sexiness<br>
but nobody is gnna use those words<br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/img/cap_549.png"><br>
hey why not take one of these too?<br>
