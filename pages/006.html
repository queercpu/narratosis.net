 I want to particpate in the yuri jam 2023 that Nadia is hosting... <br>
 there's no requirement to do anything in renpy so I can try my abilities with C programming to make at least a demo or a sketch... still many questions to be answered~ but im less afriad. <br>
 i think it'll be healthy to be chill and easy ~ no competition~ when i was asked to pariticpate in mutant mixtapes it felt like a competition even tho there's a charity invovled~ in reality, I'm being told gossip abt what the panel thinks abt the submissions... <br>
 im sure they didn't like my /f submission that drunken sentai beat style was prolly too out of bounds for them.... they didn't even follow up which is what I wanted anyways. <br>
 <br>
 its sunday so i dont plan to stress <br>
 but tarot did say to be creative today <br>
 page of wands <br>
 my first thought was to sketch out a simple tarot cli tool... that would take up the whole day just filling out the struct...  <br>
 or I can map out this yuri game. <br>
 i might as well see abt making what I thought abt yesterday the simple call-center game. <br>
 <br>
 i signed up to chatGPT to ask for advice on C <br>
 it's impressive so far <br>
 I feel the book i have + GPT will make learning programing by myself easy and acessible... I dont feel I need to go to CS school or anything like that... it's the best teacher I can have. and it's free and infinetly patiently. <br>
 <br>
 firefox takes nearly 60 seconds to open these days. <br>
 <br>
 my current goals for yuri game jam <br>
 <br>
 a short story @ the BBCC apophenia. Twigs before she's on the ship...  She's doing EPF work. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 ok so i thought abt doing a 3 way with sofa and devi <br>
 in the name of a yuri vn for the jam <br>
 they both responded positively <br>
 so i went ahead and brainstomed <br>
 heres my posit for a game plane <br>
 <br>
 When sofa and I made PT, we wrote different characters~ or... we allocated the characters to eachother .. I was the only one who could write for mayday... and sofa was the only one who could write for candy. <br>
 <br>
 This is an interesting approach but I think to make it work better than it did in PT we have to have alot more communicatiosn abt what we are doing with the chara and the plot... I think mayday and candy had an obvious connection and chemestry, but I think that format will work better if we have more structure what the consequence and importance of each scene in (speaking in reagards to plot) <br>
 <br>
 I think... the vn should have strict limitations. <br>
 no more then 4 characters. <br>
 1 character per writer. sofa devi cpu = 3... and a fourth can be handled by whoever decides to be the lead writer. <br>
 <br>
 Only a few BGs. <br>
 Only a few songs. example. <br>
 a daytime song. <br>
 a location we visit song. <br>
 a sad song. <br>
 a theme. <br>
 <br>
 only 1-2 types of dissolve. <br>
 <br>
 one ctc. <br>
 <br>
 i have idea that as a framework, we can set the story up abstractly as two places. the story only occurs in two places. the first place is the home. where the character reflects and has monolgues or~ deals with a mom or a family character.  and the other place is where the mc goes and interacts with other characters. <br>
 <br>
 I think we should do a story that is magical, fantasy, and nonsensical and allow our characters to do crazy unexpected things and wield certain op powers or have op personalities...  <br>
 <br>
 i think what works is we group world build a setting and when it comes to a character, i think we should search into the depths of our ancient dragon realm to find a character we already like and know very well... and to bring them and reskin them for this new vn.  we should do a new title, new ip w/e, fresh ideas ~ something we can all be attatch to and invested in and feel passionate about. <br>
 <br>
 sofa: sprites, cgs, 1 chara <br>
 cpu: 3d, bgs,  <br>
 devi: music, 1 chara,  <br>
 <br>
 sprites: sofa <br>
 cgs: sofa <br>
 gui: cpu/sofa <br>
 music:cpu/devi <br>
 MC / main writing: cpu <br>
 chara2: sofa <br>
 chara3: devi <br>
 chara4: cpu <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 i posit the simplest vn <br>
 its just raw sprites <br>
 raw bgs <br>
 raw music <br>
 raw freestyle writing thats fun  <br>
 lets make the primary gift be the story and characters are special and memorable and have an intense effect also high gay levels / energy. <br>
 low resolution too... 640x480. <br>
 engine renpy; unless cpu is able to make something in C ~ which is unlikely at the time. <br>
 i say we build most of the VN out purely on paper and art before we even touch renpy to keep the code off our backs and not worry abt it~ like, when we do renpy let's not give ourselves much time to over analyze the little scripting art stuff lets keep it raw and make sure our core assetts and script is super fucking on point and let that shit outshine whatever roughness the vn as a program has. <br>
 and we can even cut sofas sprites out raw so theres a subtle white outline like some of the old styles <br>
 that would suit sofas painting style anyways <br>
 im down to serve as a director for it <br>
 and be a lead writer <br>
 but we can make the world and concept be a group thing and also weigh in like we can openly commnicate about it ~ but to make things easy we just can have the final say on a certain thing like, if yr writing a chara and we have a disupute over it, you can have the final say for whaever reason even if we think it's a bad idea <br>
 full trust w/e <br>
 it doesn't matter if something isn't perfect <br>
 <br>
 made some music today but nothing exportable <br>
 just sketches and vibes <br>
    <br>
 <br>
 chatgpt is cool <br>
 but it cant do it for you <br>
 although it 'seems' like it can <br>
 it cant <br>
 it produces code that doesnt work <br>
 so what its useful is to cater to positive learning <br>
 and assistance <br>
 but it cant do real work <br>
 that is still up to us <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 i dont got the drums yet yo <br>
 only them cheapy onez or <br>
 its too lazy to set up <br>
 should? <br>
 or shoudl Itarot <br>
 or should I tea <br>
 tea.... <br>
 <br>
 flailing in the ocean water <br>
 my hands cupsing the brink of my death <br>
 the fumes rising above us <br>
 a pallid humor of sentimental glory <br>
 yet im distaught <br>
 panicking and gasping in bouts of doubt <br>
 azbi! is all I can say crying at the top of my lungs <br>
 at least... what little air I can strive to fit in as I'm jumping between breaths triggered by the ice cold sensations dominating my entire body <br>
 dragging me down <br>
 into this abuss <br>
 that never ends beneath me <br>
 a pitch black darkness <br>
 azbi!!!!!!!!! <br>
 When I turn her over on the panel she was clutching too I knew immediately... <br>
 but I didn't want to accept it <br>
 i wanted her to pirk up and smile <br>
 and laugh for tricking me  <br>
 but every passing second I don't get that confirm <br>
 is multiplication of the pain growing in my heart <br>
 AZBI <br>
 AZBI NO <br>
 IT CANT BE!!!!!! <br>
 IT CANT FUCKING BEEEE!!!! <br>
 IT CANT FUCKING BE ANYMORE NO MORE OF THIS STUPID BULLCRAP!   <br>
 I HATE ITTTTTTT!!!!!! <br>
 I!!! <br>
 HATEEEEEE!!! <br>
 YOUUUU!!!!!!! <br>
 ALL OF YOUU!!!!!! <br>
 AHhhhhaaaawhh...ahh....a.a.......... <br>
 sniff..sniff.....snort.... <br>
 it feels like my heart is going to explode out of my chest.... what was it all for? <br>
 why is this ncessary? <br>
 why does everything have to happen like this? <br>
 why does it come to a thing like this? <br>
 this isn't fair <br>
 it's contrived and made up <br>
 there's no way this can be rela <br>
 yet why is it so painful <br>
 because it's too real? <br>
 <br>
 In the distance where the burning fire sinks into the riding oil the flickering lights cascade across the tips of the ice waves.. <br>
 <br>
 Glistening... speckled star dewies talking abt the midnight sky...  <br>
 <br>
 SCENE SUNFLOWE RFIELD <br>
 This is it then? <br>
 This is where everything ends? <br>
 and begins as well? <br>
 hey please don't kid me anymore <br>
 can I get an answer about all this? <br>
 about all this nothingness? <br>
 about all this craziness? <br>
 abt out this every fucking shit man! <br>
 what the fuck is this? <br>
 why are you so suspcious? <br>
 I'm here <br>
 I'm at the end of my life now. <br>
 I'm dead. <br>
 can you tell me now???? <br>
 *RRSHHH* <br>
 Im not scared anymore! <br>
 Viva... <br>
 DOn't run away. <br>
 Uzi.  <br>
 plz be nice to me. <br>
 mica. <br>
 plz don't hate me. <br>
 Q... <br>
 fuck you. <br>
 <br>
 stei <br>
 <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 .................... <br>
 are you scared??.... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 are you sad? <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 are you lonely? <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 is it cringe? <br>
 is it ironic? <br>
 .................... <br>
 ..................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 whats the use of trying to do the right thing <br>
 its all meaningless..... <br>
 whats the poitn of everything ? <br>
 just to be an actor script? <br>
 just victim to predetermination? <br>
 this is fucked up. <br>
 and seriously dumb. <br>
 when i believe there's more to life than meets the eye... I'm not thinking about some insignificant thing...  It's the most important thing.. that's what Viva was always trying to tell me... <br>
 she knew there was more to life than meets the eye <br>
 and shes just curious to know more about it <br>
 who doesn't? <br>
 why did I doubt her <br>
 and question her... <br>
 thinking she was insincere... <br>
 I still love her... <br>
 even though we can't be together. <br>
 if I really think about the reality of a relatinship <br>
 it doesn't matter if we have a happy life together <br>
 or get to have some normie book of chapters <br>
 we aren't made for that <br>
 we aren't made for eachother in that way <br>
 IM JUST INTO ABUSIVE PEOPLE <br>
 BECAUSE I"M ABUSER MYSELF <br>
 AND I WANT TO BE ABUSED ALL THE TIME <br>
 NO WONDER I WNATED TO JOIN THE LOVE CORP <br>
 I WANTED TO BE ABUSED <br>
 SO I CAN BE ABUSIVE <br>
 I WANTED TO OVERCOME MY ABUSE <br>
 BY BECOMING ABUSIVE <br>
 <br>
 its another day... <br>
 and im not keeping track of this diary <br>
 whether should be split up <br>
 not gnna <br>
 i didnt feel like posting yesterdays batch because of the writings contained in this particular post felt a little craycray <br>
 <br>
 also was really thinking alot abt different things <br>
 i ended up making a bunch of music <br>
 <br>
 ok... <br>
 coding today.. <br>
 tryna get this simple tarot program to work <br>
 its not easy to solve problems.. so i've rely on chatgpt to guide me alot. <br>
 I've had to negotiate alot <br>
 by taking what suggests <br>
 but write my own concept <br>
 then passed the code to chatgpt to see if it can help me fix it... <br>
 it created an alternative version of the program i wrong <br>
 keeping my switch statements <br>
 and the issue of displaying the tarot cards with a dissolve fade... and fading out was glitchy...  <br>
 chat had to fix it for me... <br>
 which it did... <br>
 but I feel a little lost ~ im not sure if I learned anything <br>
 but I managed to get my hands dirty with code <br>
 it gets big quickly... <br>
 im not worried if I wasn't able to single handedly do this <br>
 this is just learning shit anyways so i dont rly care if I suck or not <br>
 made 5 cards in dpixed to work with... <br>
 its much easier to work with this... <br>
 its hopeful wishful fantasy dreaming i can get a simple vn engine running anytime soon lol <br>
 but i still wont let the feat daunt me <br>
 i like the feeling of code <br>
 i like that its all laid out in front of you <br>
 and what you put there is what you're working with <br>
 that suits my brain or... <br>
 i like building a house and knowing every corner <br>
 it feels right <br>
 or this is the sort of relatiosnhip i want to have with computers <br>
 the card i got this morn was reversed 10 of cups <br>
 so i took it as a kind loss vibes... <br>
 not gnna be coming out end of the day feeling like a king with all the sauce in the world <br>
 id like a generic reader tho <br>
 thats tarot "card" and it gives me the reading <br>
 in the commandline <br>
 im just interested to have commandline and simple utilities that cater to my habits.. <br>
 checking cards. <br>
 seekign readings <br>
 id like to not rely on internet for information #1 <br>
 or be able to choose not to <br>
 i can read cards by myself <br>
 but its nice to have some structure to them, that others have agreed upon <br>
 sorry it was 9 of cups <br>
 "wish fufillment" <br>
 well ill just take it that Im not gnna get my wish fufilled today regarding code <br>
 if im honest with myself abt what my wish is <br>
 is to have a serious understanding of whats going on and how to fix and change things <br>
 that I don't have... <br>
 but Im able to fuck around and modify stuff <br>
 it feels natural for me <br>
 the language itself I can roughtly follow <br>
 but theres still a certain bulb in my head that hasn't clicked yet <br>
 i can read into things all day <br>
 card 5 the one i made today paired with tower. <br>
 thats one of my birth cards. <br>
 coding is difficult. <br>
 or it seems difficult to get into the swing of it without strings / training wheels <br>
 chatGPT feels like serious baby trainingwheels but <br>
 it's not perfect or <br>
 theres the flaw that it makes mistakes with the code <br>
 and I dont trust that it's idea of what should work is ideal... or... id rather trust a human teachers input than chatGPT...but it's better than nothing... <br>
 it works for what I have right now. <br>
 at first I thought it was brilliant and was gnna solve the issue of not having a teacher but, I can see how a human would be better to learn code <br>
 i just doubt they'd have the amount of patience chat has <br>
 because chat can recieve my orders commands with any tonality or.. <br>
 i can just say, fix this for me plz... <br>
 and it tries to do it... <br>
 <br>
 ok so its not a total fail today but <br>
 i dont feel like ive gotten any tangible progress <br>
 so gnna take a break and drink tea.... <br>
 <br>
 devi sofa and I might team up to make a VN for the yuri game jam <br>
 since its hyper unrealistic id be able to get our own little engine (even if shitty) we can just slap it together in renpy quickly <br>
 <br>
 but im gnna suggest we keep our artistic prowess as far away from renpy as possible and only do that when its near time to release cuz <br>
 i want rawness to work in our favor <br>
 as long as the soul essense is slappin <br>
 which i think~ with our combined powers, that's inevitable <br>
 even if we don't try very hard <br>
 and be 'careless' <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 the problems I ran into today aren't about not understanding that functions do.. and assignments... <br>
 its the conditional logic~ there are some simple math operations that seem common... or to make sure things fall within a given range or... number management with variables and * .. /... %... atm I don't have intuition to use those... I have to consult the code gods..and the AI TT__TT... <br>
 im clueless many regards <br>
 but i did learn things <br>
 i understand that drawTextureEx is "extended" lol <br>
 i understand Vector2 is just x and y... <br>
 this is so boring to relate but <br>
 this is just a diary n that <br>
 <br>
 ask expected <br>
 asking 2 much of tarot isnt very productive <br>
 counterproductive <br>
 hotflaming coals <br>
 in my goldshoe <br>
 i have to ask myself <br>
 again <br>
 these questiosn if this is smart or ont <br>
 but im impatient primarily <br>
 and i think abt when I was first starting to make music... <br>
 how hard it was to get things really goin <br>
 but gettin an sp into the headspace is far easier than getting code into the headspace <br>
 or there seems alot more foundational knowledge required to get it goin <br>
 the advice from anon 'stop over thinking it and bash yr head against and wall and keep learning' made alot of sense to me....its easy to worry and somehow let that worry invalidate inner worth.. <br>
 like EGO? <br>
 my little ego gettin hurt on a daily basis because I'm not there yet? <br>
 life's a journey not a destination how far can you fly with broken wings? <br>
 even still im harsh on myself abt music <br>
 its enver enough <br>
 keep changing the details <br>
 keep tinkering <br>
 i think im at my outer limits what I can take <br>
 but i have to go there to know <br>
 i have to test myself or something <br>
 at my outer limits <br>
 to make sure im keepin myself motivated or something <br>
 ig if I was not filled with desires to program id never consider it <br>
 id say 'its too difficult' <br>
 but somehow, ive always wanted to know <br>
 the first thing I expressed as a child... that I wanted to be... was a programmer <br>
 the first thing I expressed wanting to be 'when I grow up' is to be 'a programmer like dad' <br>
 <br>
 that was my idol ig <br>
 dad was at work all the time <br>
 dad was at the computer all the time <br>
 dad was grinding makin software in C++ <br>
 dad told me functional programming was transformative to his most recent program <br>
 well ofc Dad is interested in me learning programming <br>
 it means we can talk about something <br>
 and share an interest <br>
 he def cant talk abt that with his kids or his wife <br>
 but he can with me and I can find it interesting <br>
 or informative <br>
 because im geuinely interested <br>
 i admit that or i see that most of my fixation on hardware and software was because it was relfecting in my universe <br>
 that as I searched for answers abt the laws of my fantasy world <br>
 the more Computers and software and codes presented themselves as rules I can take or leave.. <br>
 or concepts and roadmaps <br>
 roadmaps <br>
 i just follow the steps laid out in the map <br>
 and rebrand and understand <br>
 innerstand it whatever <br>
 melodrama <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 the win im taking is getting bump.ogg to play everytime i click mouse and show a new card...even the cardback....its silly but funny.... <br>
 i feel good ig now i managed to get a smile out of me... <br>
 <br>
 my hand is croaking <br>
 gnna rest but one last diary doodle <br>
 i found myself most ejnjoying code when i felt at odds against the program...so i took joy cleaning the place up and adding comments to stuff <br>
 that helped me take my mind of the immediate problem <br>
 also i foudn its hard to quickly change things <br>
 it feels like every move takes seirous consideration how it affects other things <br>
 its a delicate operation <br>
 but i love how delicate it is... asking you to be as deliberate as possible... <br>
 that means going slow <br>
 which is healthy anyways cuz my hands yo... <br>
 i drew some today as well <br>
 feeling burnt out phyiscally <br>
 wishmy hand had more strength <br>
 the last tarot card I made is my favorite.. <br>
 its just a real girl... <br>
 somehow it feel easier to be clean with pc.. <br>
 those eraser marks be perfect <br>
 i might get a screen tab sometime <br>
 but dnno if I can expect much out of myself <br>
 its unbearable feeling <br>
 how patient i have to be  <br>
 to make it anywhere in the name of art <br>
 ART <br>
 SURVIVAL <br>
 dnno <br>
 <br>
 <br>
