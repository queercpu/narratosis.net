 I want to particpate in the yuri jam 2023 that Nadia is hosting... <br>
 <b>TEXT REDACTED</b>
 <br>
 its sunday so i dont plan to stress <br>
 but tarot did say to be creative today <br>
 page of wands <br>
 <b>TEXT REDACTED</b>
 <br>
 i signed up to chatGPT to ask for advice on C <br>
 it's impressive so far <br>
 I feel the book i have + GPT will make learning programing by myself easy and acessible... I dont feel I need to go to CS school or anything like that... it's the best teacher I can have. and it's free and infinetly patiently. <br>
 <br>
 (my opinions change quickly)<br>
 firefox takes nearly 60 seconds to open these days. <br>
 <br>
 <b>TEXT REDACTED</b>
 full trust w/e <br>
 it doesn't matter if something isn't perfect <br>
 <br>
 made some music today but nothing exportable <br>
 just sketches and vibes <br>
    <br>
 <br>
 chatgpt is cool <br>
 but it cant do it for you <br>
 although it 'seems' like it can <br>
 it cant <br>
 it produces code that doesnt work <br>
 so what its useful is to cater to positive learning <br>
 and assistance <br>
 but it cant do real work <br>
 that is still up to us <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 i dont got the drums yet yo <br>
 only them cheapy onez or <br>
 its too lazy to set up <br>
 should? <br>
 or shoudl Itarot <br>
 or should I tea <br>
 tea.... <br>
 <br>
 flailing in the ocean water <br>
 my hands cupsing the brink of my death <br>
 the fumes rising above us <br>
 a pallid humor of sentimental glory <br>
 yet im distaught <br>
 panicking and gasping in bouts of doubt <br>
 azbi! is all I can say crying at the top of my lungs <br>
 at least... what little air I can strive to fit in as I'm jumping between breaths triggered by the ice cold sensations dominating my entire body <br>
 dragging me down <br>
 into this abuss <br>
 that never ends beneath me <br>
 a pitch black darkness <br>
 azbi!!!!!!!!! <br>
 When I turn her over on the panel she was clutching too I knew immediately... <br>
 but I didn't want to accept it <br>
 i wanted her to pirk up and smile <br>
 and laugh for tricking me  <br>
 but every passing second I don't get that confirm <br>
 is multiplication of the pain growing in my heart <br>
 AZBI <br>
 AZBI NO <br>
 IT CANT BE!!!!!! <br>
 IT CANT FUCKING BEEEE!!!! <br>
 IT CANT FUCKING BE ANYMORE NO MORE OF THIS STUPID BULLCRAP!   <br>
 I HATE ITTTTTTT!!!!!! <br>
 I!!! <br>
 HATEEEEEE!!! <br>
 YOUUUU!!!!!!! <br>
 ALL OF YOUU!!!!!! <br>
 AHhhhhaaaawhh...ahh....a.a.......... <br>
 sniff..sniff.....snort.... <br>
 it feels like my heart is going to explode out of my chest.... what was it all for? <br>
 why is this ncessary? <br>
 why does everything have to happen like this? <br>
 why does it come to a thing like this? <br>
 this isn't fair <br>
 it's contrived and made up <br>
 there's no way this can be rela <br>
 yet why is it so painful <br>
 because it's too real? <br>
 <br>
 In the distance where the burning fire sinks into the riding oil the flickering lights cascade across the tips of the ice waves.. <br>
 <br>
 Glistening... speckled star dewies talking abt the midnight sky...  <br>
 <br>
 SCENE SUNFLOWE RFIELD <br>
 This is it then? <br>
 This is where everything ends? <br>
 and begins as well? <br>
 hey please don't kid me anymore <br>
 can I get an answer about all this? <br>
 about all this nothingness? <br>
 about all this craziness? <br>
 abt out this every fucking shit man! <br>
 what the fuck is this? <br>
 why are you so suspcious? <br>
 I'm here <br>
 I'm at the end of my life now. <br>
 I'm dead. <br>
 can you tell me now???? <br>
 *RRSHHH* <br>
 Im not scared anymore! <br>
 Viva... <br>
 DOn't run away. <br>
 Uzi.  <br>
 plz be nice to me. <br>
 mica. <br>
 plz don't hate me. <br>
 Q... <br>
 fuck you. <br>
 <br>
 stei <br>
 <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 i dont want to be alone anymore <br>
 .................... <br>
 are you scared??.... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 are you sad? <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 are you lonely? <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 is it cringe? <br>
 is it ironic? <br>
 .................... <br>
 ..................... <br>
 .................... <br>
 whats the use of trying to do the right thing <br>
 its all meaningless..... <br>
 whats the poitn of everything ? <br>
 just to be an actor script? <br>
 just victim to predetermination? <br>
 this is fucked up. <br>
 and seriously dumb. <br>
 when i believe there's more to life than meets the eye... I'm not thinking about some insignificant thing...  It's the most important thing.. that's what Viva was always trying to tell me... <br>
 she knew there was more to life than meets the eye <br>
 and shes just curious to know more about it <br>
 who doesn't? <br>
 why did I doubt her <br>
 and question her... <br>
 thinking she was insincere... <br>
 I still love her... <br>
 even though we can't be together. <br>
 if I really think about the reality of a relatinship <br>
 it doesn't matter if we have a happy life together <br>
 or get to have some normie book of chapters <br>
 we aren't made for that <br>
 we aren't made for eachother in that way <br>
 IM JUST INTO ABUSIVE PEOPLE <br>
 BECAUSE I"M ABUSER MYSELF <br>
 AND I WANT TO BE ABUSED ALL THE TIME <br>
 NO WONDER I WNATED TO JOIN THE LOVE CORP <br>
 I WANTED TO BE ABUSED <br>
 SO I CAN BE ABUSIVE <br>
 I WANTED TO OVERCOME MY ABUSE <br>
 BY BECOMING ABUSIVE <br>
 <br>
 its another day... <br>
 <br>
 also was really thinking alot abt different things <br>
 i ended up making a bunch of music <br>

 i like that its all laid out in front of you <br>
 and what you put there is what you're working with <br>
 that suits my brain or... <br>
 i like building a house and knowing every corner <br>
 it feels right <br>
 or this is the sort of relatiosnhip i want to have with computers <br>
 the card i got this morn was reversed 10 of cups <br>
 so i took it as a kind loss vibes... <br>
 not gnna be coming out end of the day feeling like a king with all the sauce in the world <br>
 <font color="red"><b>TEXT REDACTED</b><br></font>

 <br>
 ask expected <br>
 asking 2 much of tarot isnt very productive <br>
 counterproductive <br>
 hotflaming coals <br>
 in my goldshoe <br>
 i have to ask myself <br>
 again <br>
 these questiosn if this is smart or ont <br>
 but im impatient primarily <br>
 and i think abt when I was first starting to make music... <br>
 how hard it was to get things really goin <br>
 but gettin an sp into the headspace is far easier than getting code into the headspace <br>
 or there seems alot more foundational knowledge required to get it goin <br>
 the advice from anon 'stop over thinking it and bash yr head against and wall and keep learning' made alot of sense to me....its easy to worry and somehow let that worry invalidate inner worth.. <br>
 like EGO? <br>
 my little ego gettin hurt on a daily basis because I'm not there yet? <br>
 life's a journey not a destination how far can you fly with broken wings? <br>
 even still im harsh on myself abt music <br>
 its enver enough <br>
 keep changing the details <br>
 keep tinkering <br>
 i think im at my outer limits what I can take <br>
 but i have to go there to know <br>
 i have to test myself or something <br>
 at my outer limits <br>
 to make sure im keepin myself motivated or something <br>
 ig if I was not filled with desires to program id never consider it <br>
 id say 'its too difficult' <br>
 but somehow, ive always wanted to know <br>
 the first thing I expressed as a child... that I wanted to be... was a programmer <br>
 the first thing I expressed wanting to be 'when I grow up' is to be 'a programmer like dad' <br>
 <br>
 that was my idol ig <br>

 i admit that or i see that most of my fixation on hardware and software was because it was relfecting in my universe <br>
 that as I searched for answers abt the laws of my fantasy world <br>
 the more Computers and software and codes presented themselves as rules I can take or leave.. <br>
 or concepts and roadmaps <br>
 roadmaps <br>
 i just follow the steps laid out in the map <br>
 and rebrand and understand <br>
 innerstand it whatever <br>
 melodrama <br>
 <br>
 no wonder.<br>
 childhood is the huge deal for me in terms of artistic interest...<br>
 <br>
 the win im taking is getting bump.ogg to play everytime i click mouse and show a new card...even the cardback....its silly but funny.... <br>
 i feel good ig now i managed to get a smile out of me... <br>
 <br>
 my hand is croaking <br>
 gnna rest but one last diary doodle <br>
 its nice when you are just a code maid.<br>
 its a delicate operation <br>
 but i love how delicate it is... asking you to be as deliberate as possible... <br>
 that means going slow <br>
 which is healthy anyways cuz my hands yo... <br>
 i drew some today as well <br>
 feeling burnt out phyiscally <br>
 wishmy hand had more strength <br>
 the last tarot card I made is my favorite.. <br>
 its just a real girl... <br>
 somehow it feel easier to be clean with pc.. <br>
 those eraser marks be perfect <br>
 i might get a screen tab sometime <br>
 but dnno if I can expect much out of myself <br>
 its unbearable feeling <br>
 how patient i have to be  <br>
 to make it anywhere in the name of art <br>
 ART <br>
 SURVIVAL <br>
 dnno <br>
