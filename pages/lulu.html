maybe u thought I was never gnna do this again<br>
and the people pointing fingers into darkness<br>
confused, spreading heresay and going so far as defamation<br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/img/lulu/lulu2.gif"><br>
but u better guess again though<br>
epic bandcamp thought they could win this battle by playing tactics...<br>
but they know nothing about strategy!!!<br>
<img src="https://narratosis.net/img/lulu/lulu3.gif"><br>
but this was my plan all along<br>
to make /f music PUBLIC DOMAIN<br>
with no option to even donate!<br>
.......<br>
I, lulu, command you to <br>
LOVE /F FOREVER<br>
